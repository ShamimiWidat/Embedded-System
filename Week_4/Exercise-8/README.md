# Counting the push button value

Hi everyone, this is a quick and simple tutorial on counting the amount of time for each push button has been pressed. 

Instead of using the cliche way to code the program, this code uses array and object oriented programming (OOP) format.

Guidances to be refered have been attached such as code, picture, video and schematic diagram of the experiment.

# Parts needed:

1x Arduino (NANO)

1x Breadboard

5 Push Button

10x Wires (min)

Serial Monitor

# Wiring the circuit:

Pin Assignments:

D3  = PB 1's anode leg

D4  = PB 2's anode leg

D5  = PB 3's anode leg

D6  = PB 4's anode leg

D7  = PB 5's anode leg

GND = All PB' cathode legs 

No resistor is needed as the microcontroller pull-up resistor is used

Note that this experiment can still be done with different type of Arduino, LEDs and resistors by modifying the pin assignment and value:

- If using other Arduino, the pins assign to the PBs shall always be a digital or analog pin.
- Any type of PBs that are suitable for the circuit is okay.

# Code the program

The code provided on the page has been commented with layman words to ease the understanding of the program flow

The results and simulation of the program have been attached.


# Thank You
