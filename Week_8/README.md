# Reading and Writing value to the EEPROM of Arduino

Reading and writing to the EEPROM can  be done by enabling the address, data and control registers to read and write the data.

# Registers:

0x40 = data register (EEDR)
0x3F = control register (EECR)
0x41, 0x42 = address register (EEAR)

The data be displayed via Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE

Thank you.
